If you are new to programming and looking for resources, here are a few to get started:
 
http://www.dotnetperls.com/
	Well written, clear and concise examples of common functions
 
http://stackoverflow.com/
	Great for really specific questions that involve things not working like you’d expect.
	Be careful about asking questions yourself until you’ve got a feel for what the community
	Considers a good question though. Before you get started, make sure you carefully read 
	Through the Help Center.  I have found that following the advice there for how to ask a
	Good question has resulted in me being a better programmer. 
 
http://www.codeproject.com/
	This site is jam packed with example programs and articles.
	The forum is also a great alternative to StackOverflow.
 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms123401.aspx
	The official documentation. 
	Some pages might not look so helpful, but dig deeper. 
	There is a mountain of information there.
	Try this for example: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/jj153219.aspx
	One of the first things you’ll probably need to get memorized are the VB Operators / C# Operators
 
http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C-Sharp-Fundamentals-Development-for-Absolute-Beginners
	Why read a book when you’ve got free instructional videos? 
	These are a great way to learn the things you’ll be using a lot in the future.
