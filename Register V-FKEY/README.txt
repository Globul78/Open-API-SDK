V-FKEY stands for Vertical Function Key (menu).

The command line application RegisterVfkey.exe is designed to be called by an 
application's installer and creates a short-cut in the vertical function key menu.

Users may manually add or remove short-cuts from the V-KEY menu by running 
C:\OSP-P\V-FKEY\SVFKA-SET.EXE while in Windows Only Mode. 

RegisterVfkey.exe allows the process to be automated (called by a script) 
and will work even while the OSP control is running.

For details about how to use the application, run it with the 
command line switch '/?'


"RegisterVfkey.exe /?"
